											<h3> 1.	Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? </h3>
											
											<p>I work as the Store Support Manager for the IT Helpdesk at Officeworks.
												<br />	I am in charge of a team of 6—7 people who take inbound interactions from all Officeworks stores around Australia with IT related issues. As part of my day to day I have a number of duties including:
										  <br /><br />  •	Incident Management
												<br />	•	Escalation Management
												<br />  •	Team Leading
												<br />  •	Assisting with inbound interactions.
												<br />  •	Reporting and analytics
												<br /><br /> 
													The crux of my role is coordinating and communicating with all the different teams to make sure everyone knows what everyone else is doing as well making sure we mitigate the amount of time any service is unavailable to the stores.
													The other part of my role is manging the team itself and making sure they have the tools they need to do their job. This includes the knowledge and training to be effective in their role.
													I also have to run reports and analytics on the call drivers. This is to identify problems and issues that multiple stores are getting and then find ways to reduce that number.
													</p>

											<h3>2.	Please tell us about the industry you work in. </h3>

											<p>
													IT is a fluid and ever-evolving industry.<br />
													The way we work changes as developments in business practices change as well as when business objectives change. 
													Officeworks is not an IT company so the goal of it's IT department is to align itself with the business objectives. 
													This means that everything we do is to support the Officeworks objectives as a retailer.
													</p>

											<h3>3.	What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>

											<p>Other duties that are not part of my role are:<br /><br />
													•	Change Management<br />
													•	Hardware Coordination<br />
													•	Vendor relationships<br /><br />
													Change management is a key component to the ITIL framework.<br />
													It is important that all parties know that a change is being put into place in case anything goes wrong or that there may be some kind of service outage. <br />
													It is also important to be able to have a record of what exactly the change entails and what risks are involved.<br />
													As an example when a developer wants to push some code change into a production system they need to make sure that other teams working in that same environment know there may be an outage while a server gets rebooted.<br />
													<br />
													Hardware coordination is making sure that the vendors that supply our equipment have the knowledge and ability to go onto a site and fix hardware issues. This means making sure that they have enough stock in their warehouses as well as having the correct documentation to give to their technicians who will be fixing the problem.<br />
													<br />
													In any industry, communication is vital and a key factor to getting things done. Part of my role is to manage the relationships we have with our vendors. Vendors in this context are any 3rd party organisation that assist us in helping the business achieve their goals. This means that I attend monthly/weekly meetings with representatives of these teams to discuss any issues and look at ways of improving the way we work.
													</p>

											<h3>4.	Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
											
											<p>In my particular position I need to build relationships with a plethora of different people. 
												Officeworks compartmentalise their IT teams into the different areas of the business so we have a lot of different teams. 
												Each team has a set of developers as well as team managers.<br /><br />Officeworks IT department have the following teams:<br />
										<br />	•	Web Support – who work on maintaining and improving the website<br />
												•	Server Support – Who look at maintaining and patching our servers. Officeworks runs Linux/Unix and Windows servers for various different reasons.<br />
												•	Store Support – Look at making improvements in the Store space<br />
												•	Corporate Application Support – Work on SAP and SAP related issues<br /><br />
													I also interface with vendors such as Fujitsu and Lexmark.
													</p>
											
											
											<h3>5.	Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
											
											<p>		Everyone works as a team moving in the same direction. 
													Interactions with others in the industry is always about getting something done. 
											<br />  The two main questions that get asked in any transaction is: 
											<br />	What value are we going to get out of it? 
											<br />	And What objective does this achieve?
											<br />	Although this is kind of a silly question.
													</p>

											<h3>6.	What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
											
											<p>In my role the store team members are our 'clients'. 
												Their role is to support the actual customers so it is important for us to realise that any reduction in service for the Team members reduces their ability to service customers.</p>

											<h3>7.	What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>

											<p>Putting out fires. 
												Not literal fires but in my role as leader of the IT service desk it falls upon me to make sure that any priority incidents get dealt with and resolved as soon as possible.
										<br />	This means communicating with the store as well as any other support groups to make sure that work is being done and progess is being made. 
												Part of that is notifying the wider business that an issue has occurred.</p>
											
											<h3>8.	Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
										
													<p>The most challenging part of my work is the team management portion. 
													It is incredibly difficult to motivate someone to do something that they either do not want to do, or where the outcome will not impact them personally.</p>
