													INTJ-A typically represents a person who naturally works best in solitary environments, as external stimulation (social interactions, sound, sight) can prove to be a distraction. I can work well in a team, so long as there are less distractions available. (EG working in a quieter environment as opposed to a loud classroom).
													<br /><br /><strong>Learning Style </strong> <br/>
													I am an Auditory Learner, which means I absorb information best when I hear someone explain or describe a concept or practice. For me, I can confirm I learn very well while listening to a topic, and hearing someone run through a procedure or method.
													<br /><br /><strong>Creativity Test </strong> <br/>
													The creativity test I took did not give me a certain score out of a number, however it gave me 3 primary "mental comfort zones" which were:<br/>
													Reason, Evaluate and Absorb.<br/>
													To me, this indicates I use logic alongside rational thinking to learn.

													My personality type ISFP , also known as The Adventurer, represents me as an artistic and creative thinker.
													Design and aesthetics are my stronger suit, with a focus on beauty and social behaviour. Adventurers also tends to be less competitive and mainly focus on social harmony and cooperation, which indicates that I would work well in groups.
													<br /><br /><strong>Learning Style </strong> <br/>
													I got Tactile Learner as my type of learning style, being a tactile learner means that I do best hands-on. I can better understand things through a tangible interaction with something. I quite often subconsciously use physical gestures while speaking to help me get my points across.
													<br /><br /><strong>Creativity Test </strong> <br/>
													My creativity score was slightly above average, I was given the score of 76.67 out of 100. I am most creative when I am working on something I enjoy doing, and have the space and freedom to take my time. Working in a rush does not work well for me, as I like to ensure that my work is up to my satisfactory standard.

													<br /><strong>Myer-Briggs </strong> <br/>
													INTJ-  INTJs tend towards introversion and prefer solitary work. However, as a part of a team they tend to form good leaders and project managers. People who express the INTJ personality profile, tend to have a preference for logical decisions over emotional ones.
													<br /><br /><strong>Learning Style </strong> <br/>
													Tactile learner. As a tactile learner I tend to remember things best when I get to physically work through it. That is to say, by doing something, I can come to understand it more fully. At least in comparison to simply reading or being told about it.
													<br /><br /><strong>Creativity Test </strong> <br/>
													My creativity test indicated that I had a score of 70.8, on a scale of 100. This result would imply that I work best when I have a clearly defined goal but am able to define my own path to the result.

											<h3><br /> <br /> <br /> Working as a Team:</h3>
											<p>As a team, we include two INTJs and an ISFP. Despite INTJs being only 2% of the general population, they are massively over-represented in the IT field.
												<br />This makes it likely that at some point in our future we will again be working with other INTJs, meaning that this is a great opportunity to develop our skills in that area. 
												<br />Our ISFP member, Alina is a great representative of her personality type. ISFPs tend to be charming and more aware of other people’s feelings, making here a great moderator between the two INTJ members of the group. She is also artistic by nature, despite no formal studying in the area, so her work on our website template looks amazing.
												<br />Our team contains two tactile learners and an auditory learner, meaning that as a group we will likely be experimenting as we go, but making sure to take the time to discuss it. Overall we have a very creative team, expressing curiosity across the board.
												</p>
											<h3>Ideal Job Comparison:</h3>
											<div class="margin">
											<p> 
														•  Aaron: Full-Stack Developer
													<br />•  Alina: Website Developer
													<br />•  Josh: Senior/Managing Penetration Tester
											</div>
													Our ideal jobs represent a wide variety within the IT field. A common element within all three fields would be the need to learn at least the one scripting language, if not more, like JavaScript or HTML5.
												<br />We will also all require an understanding of at least the one OS, and likely more with Aaron and Josh. Aaron’s ideal role, as a Full-Stack Developer requires an extensive knowledge of different programming languages and also skills within the business world.
												<br />This is similar to Josh’s ideal role, as Managing Penetration Tester. Both will require the ability to work well as a part of a team and great communication skills. Time management and of course the Microsoft Office suite will likely be needed by all three of us.
												<br />Alina’s ideal role as a Website developer will likely allow her to have a more creative input into her work, letting her express that part of her personality. That’s not to say that all three roles aren’t creative, as they all involve complex problem solving, a deeply creative task.
