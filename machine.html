											<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>What does it do?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>
													Machine Learning is the concept of a computer system accessing massive amounts of data to make calculated decisions. 
													The aim is to have this decision making process as intelligent as possible. 
													Machine Learning, or ML is used extensively in tools or systems which have a large user base, or in systems which have massive amounts of relevant data accessible. 
											<br />  Some examples of tools which make use of Machine Learning are:<br />
											<div class="margin">
													•  Smart-device assistants (EG: Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, etc). <br />
													•  GPS Maps with live traffic (EGL Apple and Google Maps)<br />
													•  Facebook’s Facial Recognition ability to scan an image, and detect with high-accuracy who people are<br />
													•  Spotify’s ability to “learn” what music you like based on songs you play more often, songs that you skip, songs that you “like”<br />
													•  Google’s Image Search by Image feature<br /><br />
											</div>
													There are many more examples, but the ones above all share one major component: They all have access to massive amounts of data to analyze before making a decision.
									<br />	<br />	The Smart-device example is one I find interesting, in the sense that each and every time someone speaks to their phone, they are not only having their voice analyzed by a ML protocol with a resulting action or response being generated almost instantly, but they are also making the future system even better. This is because each time you use your smartphone’s assistant (providing you haven’t disabled the relevant privacy setting allowing this to occur), your very own voice is used to help refine and improve the voice-recognition software to better understand how humans speak. At the very least, every single time you use your own device’s assistant, it is better understanding you with each command, as it learns how you personally speak and pronounce certain words. The more you use it, the better it will appear to perform. This is because in essence, it “learns”.
													
									<br />	<br />	ML technologies are ever increasingly popping up in smaller-scoped uses, and I believe over the next few years, functions available thanks to ML will be almost a standard, or expected in different apps and programs. For example, when downloading a retailer’s own smart-device app, it may well be expected to have a built-in image search by image feature, where you either take a picture, or upload a previously saved image from your device, and the app will return results based on what the ML system thinks you’re looking for. You upload a picture of a set of headphones, and you’ll get back a list of headphones, with the goal of the first result being the exact product you were looking for.
													It wouldn’t be far-fetched to imagine basic programming code being written by a machine that has been given examples and context on what it is required to create. Nor would it be to assume the same for many art practices, such as painting, creating animations, producing music, etc.
													Many of these concepts are already possible today, but I believe as with anything in IT, it will evolve and improve to create a better version.
													
									<br /> 	<br />	The concept behind all of these tools and systems remain largely the same - the ability for a smart program, or a neural network to make decisions based on having access to massive amounts of data. The program is given a set of “rules” to aid in decision making. The program is also developed further by assistive feedback, which helps the machine “learn” from a past decision which may be incorrect. Without the internet, large numbers of users and testers, none of this would be possible.
													</p>

											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>What is the likely impact?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>Almost anything that is currently connected to the internet, and the people using said things. Advertisements is one that I have not mentioned yet - services which monetize their product via advertisements can better target you with personalised advertisements which typically works out better for everyone. Why receive an advertisement for a retirement village if you’re a young adult? What if instead you received an advertisement for something related to your current interests. 
													<br /><br />
													Targeted advertisement is a rapidly growing industry, and more eyes are on the methods companies use to obtain information about individuals more than ever before thanks to big company data leaks such as the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica scandal which surfaced recently. I believe personalised consumer advertisements will continue to grow, with ever increasing accuracy in terms of if the ad is useful and engaging or not.
													<br /><br />
													I think the culture behind smart-device application and web-applications will also transform, into one which expects services and platforms to know and understand the user better. Services already do this, such as YouTube’s ability to recommend what videos you might enjoy, and Netflix’s feature of what else you might “like”. These types of features will become a standard expectation for consumers of all types.
													<br /><br />
													Manual tasks is another area where ML will thrive, especially mundane, repetitive tasks. A great example of one right now which is ever evolving and learning is YouTube’s flagging system, which automatically decides if an uploaded video contains appropriate content (eg doesn’t include pornographic material, death or gruesome content, terrorist propaganda or encouragement, etc). Given the fact there is around “500 hours of video uploaded” every minute to YouTube, it would simply be impossible for humans to analyze every minute of the content to ensure it is safe. This is where ML will dominate.
													In many of these situations, jobs will become obsolete, as ML will remove the need for a large number of humans to analyze content.
													</p>

											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>How will this affect you?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>My daily life will probably face no immediate change, as the developments are gradual, and public releases of ML tools and features are not so volatile. It’s easy to get carried away and believe that in 2 years, computers will become self-aware, and humanity will be doomed. 
													<br /><br />
													In reality however, I believe economic and political setbacks, and human intervention will ensure human jobs are not replaced overnight. I believe where one job may become redundant, another will rise. I think the biggest changes over the coming years will be an increase in targeted consumer advertisements, better voice control of devices, smarter suggestions and decisions made by mobile apps and web services, and an increase in data and privacy issues. 
													<br /><br />
													Additionally, I believe an increase in awareness of data privacy will be apparent, especially thanks to recent scandals of data being illegally gained, sold and stolen. Perhaps people won’t be quite so eager and comfortable in posting or sharing confidential or personal details about themselves, or others.
													<br /><br />
													If I am to become a Full-Stack developer, I think large parts of my job will be developing tools which integrate with ML tools and services. For example, I may be involved in creating a “Search by Image” feature on a mobile app, or I could be part of developing a system to determine what settings and features an end-user may want based on their usage of an application. There are many different uses of ML that we are yet to even acknowledge or realise. I think the next few years will help realise and understand the potential application of these concepts.
