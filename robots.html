											<h3>Robots</h3>
											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>What does it do?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>
													A robot is a machine that is designed and programmed to carry out tasks more efficiently and with more precision than humans. The tasks may range from:<br />
													<div class="margin">
															•	Repetitive tasks such as robotic arms within the car manufacturing industry, they have a production line utilising robotic arms to manufacture cars - this method is much more time-efficient and cost-effective in comparison to human labour.<br />
															•	Create and manufacture all sorts of consumer products and foods <br />
															•	Dangerous tasks such as bomb defusal or investigation <br />
															•	Drone reconnaissance in difficult or dangerous areas and territories <br />
															•	Medical assistance able to provide surgeons with a precision-steady hand <br />
															•	Provide assistance and care to elderly and sick people <br />
															•	Cybernetic implants giving people born without or lost limbs the ability to control a mechanical arm, hand, leg, etc <br />
															<br />
															</div>
															One amazing example of robotics and the sort of impact they can have in modern day companies is to look at the Amazon Fulfilment warehouse where customer orders are picked and packaged. Due to the massive number of orders a company like Amazon receive which vary not only in size, but in product type as well, having humans go and pick the orders for packaging while very possible, is less efficient than having robots pick multiple orders concurrently.
												<br /><br />
															While robotics as a concept is not new, the idea of mixing robotics with a newer concept such as AI and Machine Learning could have potential to completely change the world. While I think this is something that will take more time than the next few years to become available on a consumer market, it is something to look forward to in the near future. Concepts such as human companions who can simulate development of emotions and attachment, simulate a personality and creativity. When a computer system is merged with a physical robot, it could make for a very eerie yet interesting result.
												<br /><br />
															Cybernetic limbs are another great example of what state-of-the-art robotics is capable of achieving. In recent years, engineers are able to connect robotic limbs to surgical implants into muscle tissue, which allows the user to control the mechanical parts using electrical impulses from muscle fibres, which originate from the brain’s past “muscle-memory”. The ability for a person with a cybernetic arm to pick up a grape without crushing it, or to pick up and hold a tennis ball, or bag full of shopping is quite amazing. The next evolution in this type of robotics is to print a synthetic skin, which would let the user “feel” what they are touching. The ability to use feedback receptors to simulate touching something cold, or hot, or abrasive. That’s the kind of technology we may see soon.
												<br /><br />
															Another huge difference caused by the introduction of commercialised robotics, is task automation in manufacturing industries. The car manufacturing world has cut out the majority of positions which you used to find along the assembly line. The only humans on today’s car assembly lines are those who are there for quality assurance and checking, making sure the robots are doing a perfect job each and every time. This is seen by some as an example of how bad over-automation can be, and others may see it as an inevitable increase in production, which could give rise to other jobs and positions.
												<br /><br />
															One field where robotics can be extremely beneficial for all users is in the medical and surgical world. Robots that are able to help in complex and dangerous surgeries have greatly reduced the risk involved, and in turn saved many lives. We are yet to see many fully autonomous robots performing with no human intervention, and that will probably remain to be the case for some time, as the sort of robots being used in today’s age are often only as good as how the operator can control it.
												<br /><br />

											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>What is the likely impact?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>
													Industries that are replacing human occupied jobs with robotic counterparts will suffer pushback and defiance from workers, as many people end up losing their job. This can be devastating for workers and their families, however as rough as it can be, it is inevitable.
													I believe companies can help mitigate this issue by training and offering positions which are more future proof in today’s digital world.
													<br /><br />
													Students will be, and already are massively affected by boom in the IT industry in general. Primary school children are already being exposed to coding classes, which teach the fundamentals of programming, and the number of holiday programs and extra-curricular classes available for using codable robots is ever increasing. Exposure at an early age is critical, to help engage students early on.
													<br /><br />
													One of the major downsides to any booming industry which comes to life with such speed is the resulting job loss due to machine automation making some positions redundant and obsolete. However with new technology will come brand new jobs - some of which are now increasing in the number of positions available, and others which are yet to even exist. Imagine in the future becoming a private air traffic controller for drones and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), or a self-driving car mechanic.
													A look back on history will show many instances where old technology is replaced by new, and while initial adjustment is required, people are never left completely helpless.
													<br /><br />
													
											</p>

											<div class="strong2">
												<strong>How will this affect you?</strong>
											</div>
											<div class="margin">
											<p>
													As mentioned above, many jobs are at risk of becoming redundant over the next decade, many tasks which require manual or specific tasks will inevitably be at least majorly replaced by automated machines. This is not something to fear, but to embrace. Change is not always a bad thing, the flexibility of adapting to a new role or technology is what I believe will set good workers apart from great workers.
													<br /><br />
													If education is adjusted so that students are exposed to mechanical engineering along with coding and programming at a younger age, this will help with the minimisation of common basic jobs which will eventually be replaced. I don’t believe all jobs can be replaced by machines, ones involving customer service, advanced medical care, occupational therapy, positions which often require critical thinking and reason based on dynamic and random situations are the sorts of jobs that for quite some time, I don’t believe will be replaced by machines or automation.
													<br /><br />
													I think robots who are designed to help will initially do the opposite, as they are improved and better-designed. Perhaps one day in the next few years, we’ll see the next evolution of mechanical companions who are capable of developing meaningful relationships with humans, be it simulated or not.
													<br /><br />
													The future of robotics alongside Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning is very exciting, and will continue advancement of society in what I hope will be a mostly positive way.
													<br /><br />
