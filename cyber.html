											<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
											
											<div class="margin">
											<p>Cybersecurity is a term used to describe a collection of practices that are designed to, in some way or another, protect computer systems. What these computer systems are being protected from varies from instance to instance. Most frequently the term is describing the protection of data or a system from malicious individuals or groups.
													<br /><br />
													So what exactly does someone working within this field do? Someone working as a cyber security specialist would first of all be required to understand exactly what it is that they need to protect. This can vary from people’s personal data being stored online to the physical access of machines within an office. This person will need to determine what measures would be best suited for their job and be able to explain these decisions to the people they’re working with, in a way that they’d understand. They will then go on to actually protect that data, this could involve running through prior incidents, checking their systems for unusual activity, implementing defensive procedures and identifying potential flaws. 
													<br /><br />
													As people’s dependence on computer systems increases so does their vulnerability to attack from this area. This means that Cybersecurity is an advancing area of importance and will continue to grow. However the increasingly common threat of cyber attacks on businesses is  being met by an unprepared workforce. A report from Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that by 2021 there will be 3.5 million roles within the cybersecurity workforce going unfilled. This has resulted in a current working force that is grossly understaffed and overworked. As the field requires specialised skill sets it’s not just a simple case of hiring more people. There are two responses to this issue, the first is the traditional training of students in the field, promoting security within IT as course options. The other option being heavily considered is involving the use of AI within security systems.
													<br /><br />
													The bleeding edge of cyber security today heavily involves artificial intelligence and machine learning, on both the defensive and offensive ends of the sector. Conventional cybersecurity procedures are not always effective in detecting malware and cyber-attacks. Simon Crosby, the co-founder of Bromium, a cyber security firm in the U.S., writes that the incorporation of machine learning into already existing security methods is increasing their teams’ ability to detect threats, allowing them to be a more effective group. At the moment, AI security systems are really only effective at detecting simple issues, classifying risks and responding with simple solutions. However, this does allow employees in the area to have more time to deal with larger issues. Advancements in the field of AI security might allow employers to either hire fewer workers, or at the minimum, increase the efficiency of those workers. Within the next three years, a large percentage of the work within the cybersecurity field will likely involve some level of AI. However, this depends on the progress the research into AI and machine learning makes. As it stands, the sorting being done by AI is fast but not completely reliable. As there is currently a massive need for skilled workers within the field, there is little worry that this will cause layoffs to current jobs.
													<br /><br />
													Cybersecurity is global across all computer systems and affect not only organisations but individuals as well. Almost everyone has encountered some sort of malware with their personal computers, or often enough, a friend or family member’s. The constant battle with not only maintaining the security of a family member’s computer, but also the poorly designed “Anti-malware” will hopefully become less and less of a hassle, with a continual improvement within the field. Already, companies like AVG and Norton Security have lost a lot of their reputability, with many seeing them as just as annoying to deal with as the malware itself. This has led to a uprise in free, more streamlined anti-malware programs, like Malwarebytes and Spybot. This has affected people's day to day lives, saving many people a lot of money from subscription based services. The cybersecurity of personal computers frequently comes down to the user making informed decisions on which websites they traffic and the use of anti-malware software. Anti-malware software typically uses four main methods to complete its function.
													<br /><br />
													<div class="margin">
													•  Reviewing signatures,<br />
													•  Heuristic analysis of programs,<br />
													•  Sandboxing potential malicious software,<br />
													•  and finally, the removal of malicious software.<br />
													</div>
													<br /><br />
													Reviewing the signatures of programs running in a machine is basically just a comparison of these programs to a database of known malware. The better an anti-malware program or organisation, the larger their database will be. These programs also run a heuristic analysis of  programs running on a machine. If a program is doing something that the anti-malware has flagged as malicious, it will then be either removed or moved to a “sandbox”. These sandboxes are basically a way of setting programs aside from data they may affect negatively. Now, as all of this work is automated, anti-malware software is capable of false-positives, meaning that it is usually up to the user to have the final say of whether or not to remove the programs.
													<br /><br />
													People’s physical machines are not the only issues when it comes to the average person’s risk of cyber-attack. The increasing presence of personal information being stored online is also a large concern for the average person. Increased effectiveness within cybersecurity will make these practices safer for people without impacting their day-to-day life too often. That being said, small changes to password authentication and a more widespread use of two-step verification are some of the more obvious changes, showing the market being more aware of the need for cyber security.
