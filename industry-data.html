														<p>After having a look through the burning glass data, my ideal job as being a Web Developer has not changed. Even though there is quite a few skills sets that I need to develop before becoming a Web Developer - I still like the idea that I will be able to put my creativity to good use within this career pathway. Also in the future I could also expand to other areas, for example, mobile applications etc.

														<p>Having read the burning glass data, my idea of an ideal job has not changed. However, my desire to spread out my skill set has definitely increased. I still want to work in a field that requires constant learning and updating of resources and that sense of competition that would come from working in the security field. However, seeing the demand for certain skills that would originally have been outside this skill set, has made me feel inclined to diversify. Simply to increase my hireability.
